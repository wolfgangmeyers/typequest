# **TypeQuest: A Text-based MMO RPG Adventure**

## **Overview**

TypeQuest is a novel and engaging project aimed at the development of a text-based Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) game. The project seamlessly integrates cutting-edge AI technology to establish a vibrant, dynamic, and continually evolving game world, dictated by rules set in natural language.

The goal of TypeQuest is not only to create an immersive gaming experience for players but also to demonstrate how artificial intelligence can transform and enhance our approach to game design and player interaction.

## **Project Objectives**

Our core objectives for TypeQuest include:

1. **Immersive Text-Based Adventure:** At its heart, TypeQuest is about creating a thrilling and engaging text-based adventure game. It leverages the charm and nostalgia of classic text-based games while incorporating modern features for a refreshing gaming experience.

2. **MMO Environment:** TypeQuest is designed as an MMO, enabling players from around the globe to explore and interact within a shared expansive game world.

3. **AI Integration:** AI is a crucial component of TypeQuest. It's leveraged for understanding and enforcing game rules, driving non-playable characters (NPCs), and even world-building.

4. **Persistent and Dynamic Game World:** The game world in TypeQuest is not static. It has persistent elements and events that change over time, providing a sense of continuity and dynamism.

5. **User Content Creation:** TypeQuest encourages players to contribute to the game world. With AI-assisted world-building, players can help shape the world in which they play.

## **Getting Started**

TypeQuest is built using TypeScript and uses Node.js for the server side and React.js for the client side. To get started with the project, clone the repository, install the dependencies, and follow the instructions in our comprehensive guide.
